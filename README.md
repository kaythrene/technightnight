# My Night Light
My night light includes a photo resistor that causes the LED to light up. I designed a case using onshape to hold the soldered wires. This is the outercase that connects to the bottom. The holes in the top is to put the LED and the photo resister through. And this is the sphere that is hollow on the inside to allow light to pass through. And the whole 3D printed project holds the wires. My Onshape is here: [https://cad.onshape.com/documents/327a6eb0549df308ca605ed5/w/1e0a9eda7a8ba121991fdb57/e/48c9d6f90cc7bc173687e08d?renderMode=0&uiState=67910c1de86d4a503462d78d](url)

My Input is the lightlevel of the photoresistor and an and the outputs is the LED lighting up. Here is my original tinkercad: [https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gVfvE2d4iF2/editel?sharecode=9KVXiNGDzlog34rlOVFR_UCIBsLUNFaQ4XjOofoFM04](url)

This is the diagram I used as a reference when I was soldering
